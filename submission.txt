Commit Hash                                 What is it about?

6b71b9c58a0bfdc301d609e4c5a681e7b22b3002   generating the jacoco report part 1

//The initial jacoco didnt concentrate on the main function but it concentrated the topowerclass so after view the test report 1 and realising the report missed main function ,
so added an enhanced logic to cover that part. this function is called as testMainWithValidArgs() in my unitest case.//
